## Template Collection

### Template 1: Pain Point Introduction

**Purpose:** First cold email when a clear pain point has been identified
**Best for:** High-priority leads with strong qualification score

```
Subject: [Pain point] at [Company]?

Hi [First Name],

[Personalized opening: specific observation about their company, role, or situation]

Many [industry] [role]s I work with mention [pain point] — specifically [concrete example of the problem].

I recently helped [similar company type] [specific result with numbers]. Happy to share how if that would be useful.

Would a quick conversation make sense?

Best,
Osmel

P.S. I wrote about this challenge here: [relevant blog link]
```

**Example:**
```
Subject: Quote-to-order delays at Weber Manufacturing?

Hi Thomas,

I noticed Weber Manufacturing is hiring an Operations Manager — often a sign that manual processes are becoming a bottleneck.

Many precision manufacturing CTOs I work with mention their quote-to-order process taking 3+ days — specifically the back-and-forth between sales and operations.

I recently helped a similar company reduce this from 3 days to 4 hours without custom development. Happy to share how if that would be useful.

Would a quick conversation make sense?

Best,
Osmel

### Template 2: Technology Trigger

**Purpose:** When tech stack is known and relevant
**Best for:** Companies using Salesforce AND ERP

```
Subject: Salesforce + [ERP] at [Company]

Hi [First Name],

I noticed [Company] uses both Salesforce and [ERP]. In my experience, keeping these two in sync is either seamless or a daily headache — rarely anything in between.

When [similar company type] came to me, their team was spending [X hours/week] on manual data transfers. We got it down to [result].

If keeping Salesforce and [ERP] aligned is something you're actively working on, I'd be happy to share what worked for them.

Either way, no pressure.

Best,
Osmel
```

**Example:**
```
Subject: Salesforce + SAP at Müller Distribution

Hi Anna,

I noticed Müller Distribution uses both Salesforce and SAP. In my experience, keeping these two in sync is either seamless or a daily headache — rarely anything in between.

When a similar wholesale company came to me, their team was spending 25 hours/week on manual data transfers. We got it down to under 2.

If keeping Salesforce and SAP aligned is something you're actively working on, I'd be happy to share what worked for them.

Either way, no pressure.

Best,
Osmel
```

**Example:**
```
Subject: Manual data entry costs - thought of Weber AG

Hi Thomas,

I wrote about the hidden costs of manual data entry recently, and Weber AG came to mind.

The key insight: Most companies underestimate their manual data burden by 40-60%. One client discovered their "15-minute daily sync" actually took 45 minutes when accounting for all the steps.

Here's the full article: prietoteran.com/blog/the-real-cost-of-manual-data-entry.html

If any of this resonates, happy to discuss how it might apply to your operations.

### Template 4: Case Study Teaser

**Purpose:** Share relevant success story
**Best for:** Industry match, specific pain point match

```
Subject: How [similar company type] [achieved specific result]

Hi [First Name],

[Observation connecting to their situation in 1 sentence]

A [industry] company similar to [Company] came to me with [specific problem]. Their [role] was spending [X hours/resource] on [task].

We [brief solution approach]. Result: [specific metric improvement].

Would it be helpful to see how they approached it? I can share the details if relevant.

Best,
Osmel
```

**Example:**
```
Subject: How a Zürich manufacturer cut order processing by 87%

Hi Thomas,

I noticed Weber Manufacturing processes complex custom orders — that usually means a lot of back-and-forth between sales and operations.

A precision manufacturing company similar to yours came to me with exactly that challenge. Their operations team was the bottleneck, with orders taking 3+ days to process.

We automated the quote-to-order flow using their existing Salesforce and SAP setup. Result: 4 hours instead of 3 days, 90% fewer data entry errors.

Would it be helpful to see how they approached it? I can share the details if relevant.

Best,
Osmel
