**Example:**
```
Most Salesforce-ERP integrations break within 2-4 weeks.

I've seen this happen too many times:

• Data stops syncing, but nobody notices for days
• One failed transaction blocks 100+ orders behind it
• A vendor update breaks everything overnight

In my latest article, I break down:

→ The 3 architecture principles that prevent failures
→ Why "real-time sync" is often a trap
→ Questions to ask your integration vendor

The companies that get this right spend 80% less on emergency fixes.

**Example:**
```
Manual data entry isn't just inefficient. It's a hidden tax on your best people.

Last month, I asked a client's team to track their manual data tasks for 2 weeks.

Here's what we found:

1. 23 hours/week spent copying data between systems
2. 4% error rate requiring 30-90 min each to fix
3. Their supply chain manager—with 10 years of experience—was doing copy-paste work

The fix wasn't about technology. It was about identifying which tasks should never be manual.

What percentage of your team's time goes to data entry?

```

**Example:**
```
From 3 days to 4 hours.

That's how long it now takes a Swiss manufacturer to go from quote to order.

The challenge:
12 people across 3 departments. 8 email exchanges minimum. Manual data re-entry at every step.

The approach:
Eliminate unnecessary handoffs. Automate the boring parts. Keep humans where they matter.

The result:
• 87% reduction in quote-to-order time
• 90% fewer data entry errors
• 27 hours/week saved in operations

The best part? No custom development required.
